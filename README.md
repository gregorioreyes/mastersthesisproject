My repository to my Masters Thesis Project

My research is to understand violence against women in digital space through a Data Science approach

I am a Masters student from Tecnológico de Monterrey enrolled in the Computer Science program. My Thesis supervisor is PhD Francisco Javier Cantú Ortiz (fcantu@tec.mx), and my co-supervisor is PhD Mariana Gabarrot Arenas (mariana.gabarrot@tec.mx). My student institutional e-mail is A01139438@itesm.mx. I intend to only use Twitter data in order to complete my research in my Thesis Project: "Understanding violent social discourses and structural violence in digital space: An application of Data Science approaches to Violence Against Women in Digital Space in Mexico". As mentioned in the original request, the Data Science approaches to use in Twitter data are Text Mining, Sentiment Analysis, Pattern Recognition and Unsupervised Learning.
